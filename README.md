This project aimed to preserve and present the historic Byblos Citadel using immersive technology. It was awarded Best Presentation and Best Poster by DAAD. 
We built an interactive website showcasing the Byblos Citadel with 3D models, rendered images and videos, and a VR museum tour. 
The platform also includes an AI-powered virtual guide that responds to any question related to the citadel, as well as a smart AI itinerary planner to help users organize their visit. 
The site features rich historical content, touristic information, and visitor reviews. We used React for the frontend, Mistral LLM with a Flask API for the AI, and Firebase for data storage and backend services. 
The 3D reconstructions were done with Blender, Lumion, Metashape and FrameVR.
